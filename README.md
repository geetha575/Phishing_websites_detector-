Phishing websites detection using machine learning 
The core problem lies in the lack of scalable, adaptive, and accurate detection systems that can identify phishing websites in real time. With attackers constantly modifying URLs, page layouts, and hosting strategies, there is an urgent need for intelligent systems that can learn from patterns and generalize across unseen threats.
This project addresses the challenge by leveraging machine learning algorithms to automatically detect phishing websites based on a variety of features extracted from URLs, domain information, and site content. The goal is to develop a model that can:
•	Accurately classify websites as phishing or legitimate
•	Adapt to new and evolving phishing tactics
•	Operate efficiently in real-time environments
